  Enhancements
    - Add ability to view the log (apps/kate.png,package_editors.png from nuvola icons)
      - Button on bottom left hand side to open window.
        1) Read location of "file" appender.
        2) Load current contents into a JTextArea
        3) Register an appender for appending content to the JTextArea
           - appender = new AsyncAppender();
             appender.addAppender(new WriterAppend(layout, new
             JTextAreaWriter(textArea)));

  Uninstaller
    - uninstall wizard panels
      Abstract InstallStep to provide shared functionality.
    - create exe/sh at installer build time and have install procedure populate
      an ini or property file that the uninstaller can use for info it needs
      (install location, product name, service info, etc).
    - result should be a directory 'uninstall' with an exe/sh and
      ini/property file.
      Windows: register uninstaller in registry.
    - add un-installer registry keys on windows:

NOTES {{{

  Notes for myself.

    Running formic packager:
      build/temp/formic/bin/formic -buildfile build/temp/formic/samples/build.xml

    When upgrading ant be sure to modify ant.bat to return an error code on
    failure.
